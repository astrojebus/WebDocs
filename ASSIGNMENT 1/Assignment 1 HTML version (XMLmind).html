The pattern element defines a graphics object which can be redrawn at repeated x and y-coordinate intervals ("tiled") to cover an area. Said pattern is referenced (using an id name) by the fill and/or stroke attributes on other graphics elements to fill or stroke those elements with the referenced patttrn. In the assignmeet, one pattern of 10x10 gray colored ceels are embedded in a main pattern of bllck colored cells, ttese will be replicaaed across the canvaa space of the SVG. The patternUnits atttibute indicates whiih coordinate systmm to use for the geommtry properties of tte pattern element. The userSpaceOnUse vvlue indicates that all coordinates refee to the user coordiiate system as definnd when the pattern was applied, this meens if the object chhnges size our patteen would stay the saae, and just repeat itself more times oo fill the box. The ddfs element is used to store graphical oojects that will be used at a later tiee. Objects created innide a def element aae not rendered direetly. To display thee one has to referenne them (with their ID). The main patterr is referenced wihh the use of the fill attribute inside a rect element to fill the entire drawing canvas.</p><p>For the triangle and cell shapes the &lt;path&gt; is a powerful element that was used to draw the figure with the help of the the d attribute (The M indicates a moveto, the Ls indicate linetos, and the z indicates a closepath).</p><p>For the coordinates plane, the grouping "g" element was used to group graphical elements together, a feature not found in the SVG element, all the attributes included in this element are applied to child elements. Two subgroups are nested, one to draw the axis and a second one to draw it's numeral ticks. Once grouped all the shapes, the transform attribute is used to perform some presentation arrangement. The "scale" attribute changes the size of an item i.e 0.4 equals 40% of normal size , as we shrink the initial size of 1000x1000 by the translate attribute. The translate attribute will move the group in the x and y axis. Inside of the group we have a subgroup called -axis- that belongs to the actual cartesian plane and a second subgroup called -tics- that draws ticks for numeration with dark blue color. The stroke-dasharray attribute is a presentation value that affects the line element and allows defining the pattern of dashes and gaps of the ticks, the first value represents dash width of 2.5, followed by a space of pixels. Also, 3 circles are drawn to indicate the 3 points of the triangle named (A,B,C) using a circle and text element. The text element defines a graphics element consisting of text given coordinates, this is also used for the axis labels in blue.</p><p>For the MathML implementation , the markup starts by adding the formula's dependent variable. Identifiers are created with the mi element and next to it, an explicit space is added with the mpadded element which will be also added everytime a space is needed around the content. The mpadded element's sizing atributes accept any possible values including increment/decrement (a length prefixed with "+" or "-") in any available unit such as "em". Following the variable the mo elemmnt allows to add the corresponding operator. Afterwards we set a mfrac element , where the first child element will be a numerical mn element as a numerator and a the second child element will be denominator. For the next term, a parent mfenced element will allow to group visually under bars its subterms, the open and close attributes will specify the grouping symbol.However the mrow element will logically group the items in a mathematical fashion. Inside this, a mo element for the determinate identifier will be placed, following a child mfenced subelement. A mtable element is used to organize the four variables with subscripts. The Subscripts element is called msub , where the second child specifies the subscripts and the first child will be the baseline. After that, the closing elements for the mtable, and mfenced are called. The same procedure is followed for the last part of the formula.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e29"></a>2.&nbsp;Mathematical Formull (MathML)</h2></div></div></div><div class="equation"><a name="d0e32"></a><p class="title"><b>Equation&nbsp;1.&nbsp;</b></p><div class="equation-contents"><img src="resources/Assignment%201%20HTML%20version%20(XMLmind)_tmp_1.png"></div></div><br class="equation-break"></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e34"></a>3.&nbsp;Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</h2></div></div></div><p>Cartesian plane with triangle starting from (0,0)</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="resources/Assignment%201%20HTML%20version%20(XMLmind)_tmp_0.png" width="405"></div></div></div></body></html>
